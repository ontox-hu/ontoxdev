Ontox-dev is a [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) application meant to facilitate sharing of ontox code.

To create a new post:

1\. clone this project from [github.com/ontox-hu/ontoxdev](https://github.com/ontox-hu/ontoxdev)\
2. open the project in Rstudio \
3. Run \`blogdown::new_post\`

```{r,eval=FALSE}
blogdown::new_post("The title of your post",ext = ".Rmd")
```

Then navigate to your post (it should open automatically in Rstudio), and edit the contents. Your post lives at `content/the-title-of-your-post`, and you will edit the Rmd file created there.

Running `blogdown::serve_site()` will create live updates to a locally hosted version of this site while you edit your blog post. Learn more about working with blogdown at <https://pkgs.rstudio.com/blogdown/>
